        <p> This blog was my very first project since I was discharged from the military. 
            I wanted to start fresh, and decided that I would need a place where I could document my progress as a programmer 
            and also some other plans I had in my mind. And I didn't want to just "drag and drop" to create my site. I wanted something of my own.
            Using basic html,css and also both javascript and jquery, I was able to craft the front-end part of the blog, 
            and used Google Firebase as my back-end part (I believe Firebase was the best option for me to learn about back-end as a beginner). 
            I admit that this blog may not be the best looking nor the most mobile friendly site, but I am still learning and this too will just be part of my progress.
            All the deatils regarding my projects will be posted in my blog.

          Below is just a preview of my blog.
          <br>
          Keep in mind that it's not a 100% mobile friendly site.
